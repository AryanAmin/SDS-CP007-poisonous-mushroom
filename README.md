## Project Phases & Timeline
**Research (Week 1)**

**Data Cleaning & Analysis (Week 2)**
- Handling null values, fixing data types, data inconsistencies
- EDA, understanding distributions, outliers, relationships of features with target variable
- Correlation analysis

**Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (Week 3)**
- Building new features, one hot encoding, feature scaling
- Handling outliers through statistical and heuristic methods
- Normalisation or Standardisation of input features is the ML algorithm in the pipeline requires it

**Feature Selection (Week 3)**
- Utilize impurity based feature importance, permutation feature importance and other feature importance techniques
- Align feature importance with the results from EDA to select the most predictive features 

**Model Selection & Fine Tuning (Week 4)**
- Training multiple models, comparing model metrics, selecting best performing model
- Hyperparameter tuning based on a target model metrics

**Model Explainability (Week 4)**
- Utilize Lime or Shapley values techniques to give Explainability to the model output 
- Integration of this Explainability layer to the final model deployment 

**Deployment (Week 5)**
- Building a streamlit app
- Deploying model to app
- Deploying app to streamlit cloud
